                      Cole -
                      <br>这就是今天要跟大家分享的重点，接下来会分模块仔细谈谈怎么利用这个神奇的网站。</p>
                    <p>2、simon ebook ielts-simon.com
                      <br>前面很多答案提到了simon的网站，的确很受用，适合长线备战的同学。但个人感觉排版推送都有些乱，没有topic或者question
                      type的分类，每一小块的知识点比较零碎，所以我只是把它当做dominic的补充材料来用。
                      <br>但！不得不提到simon的电子书！” Ideas for IELTS Topics”，网站上卖20英胖的那个。网上有资源，在此感谢资源贡献者。接下来第二部分IDEA部分细讲。</p>
                    <p>3、十天突破雅思写作绿皮、十天突破雅思写作蓝皮
                      <br>请扔掉它们！！！
                      <br>请扔掉它们！！！
                      <br>请扔掉它们！！！
                      <br>你们听到我声嘶力竭的呼喊了吗！！！请！扔！掉！它！们！！！
                      <br>绿皮很基础，可是背写作单词有用吗，写的时候照样不会想到用；拗复杂句式有意义吗，我定从强调倒装不定式后置前置独立主格全都用了照样6啊，而且我很自信没有语法错误啊，姐姐当年高考140+啊，没！有！任！何！毛！用！！秀逻辑论证方法有意思吗，我举例论证对比论证反面论证因果论证都用了为什么给我6，是考官瞎吗！其实原因很简单：我花式秀一堆词汇句型论证法到头来话都没讲明白。泥萌看过《超模学院》吗！就像第一集里1号女生那样呀，让你走个T台，你却上去跳舞啊！你以为自己美极了身材好极了写的作文棒棒哒，考官微微一笑大笔一挥给你个6服不服！对不起我跑偏了吐槽不想停。蓝皮范文我全都看完了，根据topic将idea总结了，每个idea能用上的单词句式也都一字一句记了下来。感觉自己真是666呢，结果真的就666了。不可否认学习范文很重要，十天系列也许有用，也许是我自我归因偏差了，是我自己打开方式不对。但是，不针对这两本书，我只是想说：
                      <br>写作最本质的就是连贯地把观点讲明白。【正经脸】</p>
                    <p>二、IDEA</p>
                    <p>如果说structure是一篇作文的骨架，idea和vocabulary肯定就是肉肉啦。刚开始备考的大家肯定或多或少都会感到无从下手，特别是加上雅思写作的话题很广，从教育到政府到犯罪等等，一开始对于一个话题，让我用中文都难以下笔。所以积累一些通用的或是针对话题特定的idea和相关vocab是首先要解决的问题。我曾经每天练一个大作文，方法就是花两个小时在YAHOO
                      Answer（类似于百度知道）里输入关键词，看人家的观点和地道用法，积累下来，再强迫自己用。在短期内，扩大了词汇量和思路，但问题是太费时间（一整个流程：收集材料2h+记忆材料0.5h+动笔写1h+自己修改1h=4.5h=一个上午）；另一个方法上面有提到，就是看十天范文。然而，真心讲，费了两个月功夫最后的收获远不如我在simon,
                      dominic两个网站上两周来得大。因为这两个网站上是根据topic将idea和相关表达直接列出，而看范文需要自己花大量时间去提炼。

                      <li>Regulation of advertising
                        <br>There is little doubt that there should be some regulation
                        of advertising, but it is unclear who should be responsible
                        for this and how the regulations should apply. On one level,
                        in the free market, companies should be allowed to promote
                        their products and services as they see fit.However, there
                        are surely some instances when it would be inappropriate
                        for there to be no restrictions on advertising. For example,
                        tobacco and alcohol companies should not be allowed to buy
                        advertising time on television and radio.
                        <br>Dominic中的vocab页有很多是口语中的，且不同的话题里包含的内容形式不同。有些是词汇+句子+范文，有些可能就只有词汇。所以词汇和思路方面倒是以simon的电子书为主，dominic网站为辅。</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>2、 如何利用
                      <br>①时间安排
                      <br>这里我把整个写作复习阶段（一个月）每天的时间安排说一下：
                      <br>⑴ simon电子书上的topic 1个/天，简单记下思路和用词
                      <br>⑵如果dominic上有相应的话题，积累其词汇句型等作为补充
                      <br>⑶找出dominic上相关话题的范文题目，自己写
                      <br>⑷对照dominic的范文，改自己的文章
                      <br>②以Advertising为例
                      <br>Step1.
                      <br>Simon电子书中“广告”话题下有三个部分：advantages, disadvantages, opinions
                      <br>比如disadvantages方面
                      <br>”Negatives”
                      <br>Advertising manipulates people
                      <br>It aims to persuade people that buying a product will make
                      them happier
                      <br>Advertisers focus on selling a brand image
                      <br>They use glamorous, successful people
                      <br>We now live in a consumer culture
                      <br>We are persuaded to follow the latest trend
                      <br>We are encouraged to associate certain brands with a higher
                      status
                      <br>Advertisers often aim their marketing at children
                      <br>Children can easily be influenced by advertisements.
                      <br>Children put pressure on parents to buy them things
                      <br>自己总结一遍广告的反面影响有：
                      <br>Idea1诱导消费者（vocab: manipulate people, consumer culture）
                      <br>Idea2 品牌效应（vocab: brand image, follow the latest trend, higher
                      status）
                      <br>Idea3 对孩子的负面影响（vocab: aim their marketing at, put pressure
                      on）
                      <br>其他两个方面advantages, opnions如上方式归纳。
                      <br>注：simon电子书中每个大的topic下内容长度不一，advertising部分算是短的，用来举例比较方便。大家看的时候可能觉得这里的单词用法和思路太“弱智”不够上档次，嗯我当初也这样觉得。不过在这里我想强调一句，我们学习词汇和思路并不是写作的目的，因为论点是否漂亮并不是剑桥雅思的评分标准，（我考试的题目是crime相关，我的论证思路很简单，让步段讲好处，转折段讲坏处，并且好坏处是很容易想到的弱智论点，考后我看了各类网上名师的范文感觉自己写偏了，可是事实证明只要论点靠谱，structure才是拿分的关键）我们积累大量词汇和思路只是为了在正式考试时短时间内有东西可以写，不至于浪费太多的时间想素材。我的观点是，idea是基础，structure是本质。
                      <br>Step2.
                      <br>补充积累dominic上关于advertising的词汇用法
                      <br>链接在这Advertising vocabulary and exercises |
                      <br>单词包括：
                      <br>Different forms of advertising(television commercial, radio
                      spot, billboard, flyer, trailer…)
                      <br>Adjectives to describe advertising(witty, persuasive, misleading,
                      word-of-mouth…)
                      <br>Other related words

                      <br>Forms of advertising
                      <br>How advertising works
                      <br>The regulation of advertising
                      <br>仍以the regulation of advertising为例</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Regulation of advertising
                        <br>There is little doubt that there should be some regulation
                        of advertising, but it is unclear who should be responsible
                        for this and how the regulations should apply. On one level,
                        in the free market, companies should be allowed to promote
                        their products and services as they see fit.// However, there
                        are surely some instances when it would be inappropriate
                        for there to be no restrictions on advertising. For example,
                        tobacco and alcohol companies should not be allowed to buy
                        advertising time on television and radio.
                        <br>-自己总结 idea
                        <br>广告监管问题：1.支持商家广告以提高自由市场上的竞争力，2.但一些种类比如烟酒类的广告需要限制。
                        <br>-自己总结vocab
                        <br>在文中已划线部分（建议将vocab分为两种，1.通用类比如there are surely some instances
                        when…2.特定话题类比如buy advertising time on sth.）
                        <br>Step3&amp;4在讲完structure后列出</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>三、STRUCTURE</p>
                    <p>重中之重。这里的结构不是指该写四段还是五段，而是一种PEE的写作逻辑和如何保证cohesion &amp; coherence（官方评分标准中强调的连贯度）</p>
                    <p>1、 PEE
                      <br>Point-explain-example
                      <br>这是dominic的详细讲解Paragraph coherence in IELTS writing
                      <br>简单说来就是给出观点（一句话），解释观点（一两句话），给出一个例子。</p>
                    <p>但这并不是固定模式。比如我在分析dominic的范文时，发现有些没有例子，那么解释的部分就长一些。有些观点有两层，那么大观点（point）可以单独列出，比如说“某某东西是值得肯定的”，小观点就可以和explain直接混为一体，不用单独再列一个小point出来，这样的段落通常是（大point–&gt;小point1+explain1–&gt;example1–&gt;小point2+explain2–&gt;example2）的模式，往往出现在两个小Point是可以用大point来概括的时候；而如果两个小point相对独立，无法用一句话加以概括，就可以不用大point来打头阵，这样的段落就可以是（point1–&gt;explain1–&gt;example1–&gt;point2–&gt;explain2–&gt;example2）
                      <br>这不是死板的模式，可以根据具体情况灵活变通，关键就在于先明晰观点再加以阐述，最好来个例子。</p>
                    <p>仍以Advertising为例，接上文</p>
                    <p>Step3 积累相关话题表达和思路之后，自己动笔写
                      <br>Step4 写完对比范文自己改</p>
                    <p>这两步我放在一起说，因为我是在自己写的作文里面改的，分不开。
                      <br>题目：Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements
                      from competing companies. To what extent do you think are consumers
                      influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to
                      protect them?
                      <br>仅以第一个主体段，即消费者在何等程度上受广告影响，为例
                      <br>加黑体是我写完之后修改的或者是注释
                      <br>Inundated with advertisements in daily life, consumers are
                      influenced without any conscious.(总起句，表明同意的态度，更simple一点比较好?
                      自改1 there is little doubt that consumers are persuaded by adverts
                      without any conscious) This can be obviously demonstrated with
                      the case of junk food targeting children and cigarette for
                      young people. (这应该算是example 应放在detail的后面)(自改1 detail–&gt;it
                      is a common sight of attractive images on most of adverts.
                      Exampleàthis is particularly evident in case of junk food and
                      cigarette targeting children or juveniles, who can hardly resist
                      the temptation of mouthwatering hamburgers and fried chips
                      on display and then buy them without thinking) Advertisements
                      of these products which are actively unhealthy are persuasive
                      by presenting some attractive virtual images, like mouthwatering
                      hamburgers and fried chips, thus urging youngsters to buy them
                      without a second thought.// Products endorsed by celebrities
                      can also be memorable and influential.(point–&gt;similarly,
                      advertising of products endorsed by celebrities could also
                      be misleading in some ways)That is to say, if Miranda Kerr
                      is using a brand of shampoo in a television commercial, countless
                      number of girls will be likely to follow suit since most people
                      tend to imitate the lifestyle of famous stars.(example) A further
                      illustration is that when you are watching a movie in a theater,
                      you would possibly have no idea that the latest goods are also
                      on display. You would possibly buy these products the next
                      time when wondering in a supermarket because you’ve already
                      got familiar with their names.(三个方面果然比较多了…直接上example会不会不太好啊，自己的逻辑更倾向于example-explain分析原因，算了还是老实改改吧
                      details–&gt;subsequently, there are also less obvious categories
                      of advertising, say billboards by the road side, flyers on
                      the streets. Example–&gt;A further illustration is that when
                      you are watching a movie in a theater, you would possibly have
                      no idea that the latest goods are also on display.)
                      <br>分析范文
                      <br>The first point to make is that advertising does make us spend
                      money we do not need to. [总起, the general idea]main idea其实就是很simple的同不同意，其中根据get
                      ideas出的挑一个深入说 // There are nowadays so many different ways
                      companies promote their products and services, ranging from
                      television commercials to simple flyers that we cannot escape
                      it[detail, there be; -ing; so…that..] // If, for example, you
                      watch a football match on television, you will see the logos
                      of the tournament sponsors. Likewise, if you watch the latest
                      blockbuster movie, very probably you will see a product placed
                      in the film by some advertising agency. [example, if…you will;
                      例子用likewise连接; -ed]//The volume of this advertising means that
                      we, as consumers, tend to be profoundly influenced by it and
                      buy without thinking.[与general idea呼应, …means…] –&gt; 每一个小段的结构也是跟大essay是一样的:
                      总分总
                      <br>注：这个需要自己不断写改之后摸索出适合自己的模式，所以我无法概括地说哪一种是普适的，但换汤不换药，PEE是万模式之源。</p>
                    <p>2、 连贯</p>
                    <p>Dominic网站我利用率最高的有三部分：
                      <br>第一、Vocabulary部分IELTS vocabulary -
                      <br>上文中提过，这是用来收集思路词汇的
                      <br>第二、Skills部分 IELTS writing task 2 -
                      <br>这一部分最为详细，各类写作技巧，我花了两天时间看完的，其中PEE和cohesion的观点对我帮助非常非常大，建议大家仔细看。我有一些对这部分的笔记，在这里就不放出了因为有些乱，我不知归到哪部分合适，我一定得了一种叫归类强迫症的病。
                      <br>第三、Sample部分Sample IELTS essays -
                      <br>这一部分的题目主要用来练习，并用范文作为修改自己文章的根据</p>
                    <p>PEE讲的其实就是段落中的连贯，一篇文章中需要连贯之处有：一个论点（PEE）中的连贯、论点间的连贯、段落间的连贯。具体讲解在这里：IELTS
                      essays 这里我觉得讲的理论性足够了，但实用性还欠缺。其实就是需要自己总结出一些通用的结构性连接性语言。我自己总结了一些，不完全列举如下：
                      <br>提出point：The first point to make is that… There can be no doubt
                      that…It could be argued that
                      <br>引出example：A good illustration of this is…This is particularly
                      the case…
                      <br>引出下一个point：There is also the consideration that…The impact
                      on… should not be forgotten
                      <br>同样地，这需要自己从范文中积累，一些很简单的词比如second, another point等等都是十分有用的，我上面列出的这些句子有些稍显冗余，需要根据特定环境来选择。这些万能的结构句被我称作skeleton，因为完全就是可以随便贴肉上去的通用骨架。</p>
                    <p>坚持看到这里的同学们真的谢谢啦。到这里我觉得核心的地方已经说完了，不知我有没有说清楚。真的很想把我感悟到的技巧跟大家分享，又担心讲不明白。有问题可以随时私信我呀。</p>
                    <p>四、学会分类
                      <br>这个主要就是在考前冲刺时的工作。我的总复习时长是一个月，刚刚也提到simon电子书上是24个话题，每天练习一个话题（我很难坚持一天写一篇，不过看一个话题还是可以的啦）刚好剩最后一周的时间可以用来总结。
                      <br>总结对象就是练习的文章，dominic上的范文题目大概有30个。那总结些什么呢。</p>
                    <p>1、 话题
                      <br>相同话题的题目在思路和词汇方面有共通之处，我大致分出了Advertising, Animal rights, Environment,
                      Education, Government, Technology, Employment, Health, Globalization,
                      Crime等话题，感觉雅思出题基本都是围绕这些来的。</p>
                    <p>2、 问题类型
                      <br>同样的问题类型的文章架构也是差不多的，比如Agree&amp;Disagree的处理方法和Advantanges&amp;Disadvantages的处理方法当然是有差别的，我大致分出了同不同意型，优缺点型，双边讨论型，原因+解决型等等。
                      <br>将30篇题目分出来就像这样啦
                      <br>
                      <img src="http://ovlvuzv80.bkt.clouddn.com/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%876.png" alt="6">
                      <br>3、 连接词–&gt;做出属于自己的模板
                      <br>比如上场率最高的同不同意型
                      <br>我考前弄的模板是这样的（不完全截图，因为太多了不能一一截下来）
                      <br>
                      <img src="http://ovlvuzv80.bkt.clouddn.com/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%877.png" alt="7">
                      <br>写在最后：
                      <br>如果有人能耐心看到最后我真的很感动！毕竟第一次尝试写干货长答案，如果这一点点东西能对大家有帮助我很开心很开心。因为自己在准备口语和写作时感觉被普遍的一些观念影响然后走偏了，比如几乎网上那些所谓资深名师都在强调口语Part2最重要，结果第一次也是老老实实写完所有part2
                      topic 然后背完，仍然666了。刚好最近忙完期末，昨天弄完实习的第一项任务，空出时间写下自己关于对写作备考的一些方法和经验，特别希望大家都能回归最本质的东西，多看看英语母语老师写的资料（培训机构的天价外教不算啊！）</p>
                    <p>关于口语，好好准备part3。</p>
                    <p>鞠躬，谢谢耐心看到这里的你。
                      <br>最后，私信讨论欢迎，但是请不要问我很大的问题比如到底怎么准备写作，怎么准备口语之类的。具体的问题交流起来更有效一些。</p>
                    <p>PS：第一次认真写长答案诶，写了整整一下午加晚上诶，都看到这里了，点个赞呗么么哒。</p>
                    <p>Ideas for IELTS topics</p>
                    <p>Who is this book for?</p>
                    <p>Many students have no ideas or opinions about IETLS writing topics.
                      Even if your</p>
                    <p>grammar is perfect, you will not get a high IELTS score if you
                      do not know what to write.
                    </p>
                    <p>This book is for students who want to go into the writing exam
                      feeling confident that they have excellent ideas, opinions
                      and vocabulary for as many topics as possible</p>
                    <p>How do you get an IELTS score of 7 or higher?</p>
                    <p>The key to a high score is not grammar, it is not your use of
                      words like “moreover” or “in addition”, and it is not your
                      use of phrases like “this is controversial issue nowadays”.</p>
                    <p>To get a high score you need to use good “topic language” (words
                      and phrases</p>
                    <p>that are related to the question topic). You need good ideas
                      in order to answer the</p>
                    <p>question well.</p>
                    <p>How should you prepare for IELTS writing task 2?</p>
                    <p>There is an enormous amount of advice on my website ielts-simon.com.
                      Here is a</p>
                    <p>summary of what I suggest:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Spend more time preparing than testing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When you test yourself, you find out what your level is, but
                      you do not learn anything</p>
                    <p>new. You will not improve if you only write test essays. Before
                      writing an essay,</p>
                    <p>study the topic and prepare your ideas, opinions and vocabulary.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Steal my ideas</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you only use the vocabulary that you already know, you will
                      not learn anything</p>
                    <p>new, and you will not improve. Practise linking my topic ideas
                      together to write</p>
                    <p>“perfect essays”. See the website for examples of how to do this.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use this book together with the website</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The website ielts-simon.com contains lessons and videos that
                      show you how to use</p>
                    <p>the ideas from this book. You can speak to me there if you have
                      any questions.</p>
