<p>Ideas for IELTS topics</p>
<p>Who is this book for?</p>
<p>Many students have no ideas or opinions about IETLS writing topics. Even if your</p>
<p>grammar is perfect, you will not get a high IELTS score if you do not know what to
  write.</p>
<p>This book is for students who want to go into the writing exam feeling confident
  that they have excellent ideas, opinions and vocabulary for as many topics as possible</p>
<p>How do you get an IELTS score of 7 or higher?</p>
<p>The key to a high score is not grammar, it is not your use of words like “moreover”
  or “in addition”, and it is not your use of phrases like “this is controversial
  issue nowadays”.</p>
<p>To get a high score you need to use good “topic language” (words and phrases</p>
<p>that are related to the question topic). You need good ideas in order to answer the</p>
<p>question well.</p>
<p>How should you prepare for IELTS writing task 2?</p>
<p>There is an enormous amount of advice on my website ielts-simon.com. Here is a</p>
<p>summary of what I suggest:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spend more time preparing than testing</li>
</ul>
<p>When you test yourself, you find out what your level is, but you do not learn anything</p>
<p>new. You will not improve if you only write test essays. Before writing an essay,</p>
<p>study the topic and prepare your ideas, opinions and vocabulary.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Steal my ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only use the vocabulary that you already know, you will not learn anything</p>
<p>new, and you will not improve. Practise linking my topic ideas together to write</p>
<p>“perfect essays”. See the website for examples of how to do this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use this book together with the website</li>
</ul>
<p>The website ielts-simon.com contains lessons and videos that show you how to use</p>
<p>the ideas from this book. You can speak to me there if you have any questions.</p>

<p>10 / 52</p>
<ol>

<p>11 / 52</p>
<p>Our aim should be improve farming methods</p>

<p>We have no right to use animals for entertainment and profit.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cities</li>
</ol>
<p>Reasons for Urbanization</p>
<p>People move to cities in search of job opportunities</p>
<p>Cities offer greater employment possibilities and a higher standard of living</p>
<p>People migrate to cities from the countryside</p>
<p>Traditional activities like farming need fewer workers nowadays</p>
<p>12 / 52</p>
<p>Negatives of City Life</p>
<p>Life in cities has its drawbacks</p>

<p>Cities lack a sense of community</p>
<p>People do not even know their neighbor</p>
<p>Cities are sometimes described as “concrete jungles”.</p>
<p>Pedestrian Areas</p>
<p>Pedestrian zones in city centre can improve the local environment</p>
<p>Banning cars encourages people to walk or cycle</p>
<p>Many European cities have built bicycle lanes</p>
<p>Dependence on cars is linked to health problems like obesity</p>
<p>People who walk or cycle regularly are generally healthier</p>
<p>Pedestrian areas are safer and more attractive for both residents and tourists</p>
<ol>
  <li>Crime</li>
</ol>
<p>Police and Crime Prevention</p>
<p>The job of the polices is to catch criminals</p>
<p>They must also prevent crime and make communities safer</p>
<p>13 / 52</p>
<p>There should be an increase in the number of police officers on the streets Police
  officers should be seen as part of the community</p>
<p>They should be involved with education and prevention</p>
<p>The police should be in close contact with schools</p>
<p>They should focus on young people who have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>These teenagers may become involved with gangs</p>
<p>Punishments/Prisons</p>
<p>Fines are used as punishment for minor crimes</p>
<p>If the crime is more serious, prison is the most common punishment</p>
<p>Some criminals pose a threat to society</p>
<p>They are put in prison to ensure the safety of other citizens</p>
<p>Negatives of Prisons</p>
<p>Criminals are put together</p>
<p>They make friends with other offenders</p>
<p>Many prisoners re-offend when they are released</p>

<p>Capital punishment</p>
<p>Supporters say that capital punishment deters crime</p>
<p>14 / 52</p>
<p>Fear of the death penalty stops people from committing offences</p>
<p>The death penalty shows that crime is not tolerated</p>
<p>It is a form of revenge</p>
<p>The cost of imprisonment is avoided</p>
<p>The offender cannot pose a threat to others</p>
<p>Against Capital Punishment</p>
<p>Innocent people could be wrongly convicted and executed</p>
<p>Crime rates are not necessarily reduced</p>
<p>Many criminals do not think they will be caught</p>
<p>Capital punishment is not a good deterrent</p>
<p>Executing prisoners creates a violent culture and encourages revenge</p>
<p>We have no right to take another human life</p>
<p>Community service</p>
<p>Community service is a way to reform offenders</p>
<p>It could be a solution to prison overcrowding</p>
<p>It avoids the cost of imprisonment</p>
<p>It makes offenders useful in their local communities</p>
<p>They are required to clean streets or talk to school groups</p>
<p>Offenders repay their community</p>
<p>They avoid the negative influence that prison can have</p>
<p>Against community service</p>
<p>Community service is not a sufficient punishment</p>
<p>Criminals should be locked up, away from their victims</p>
<p>Crime in the Media</p>
<p>Crime is one of the main subjects of most news programs.</p>
<p>15 / 52</p>

<p>Computers are expensive to maintain and can be unreliable</p>
<p>Technology in Education: Opinion</p>

<p>17 / 52</p>
<p>Technology is part of everyday life</p>
<p>It can enhance a teacher’s lessons</p>
<p>Students can use online resources to help with homework</p>
<p>Students must still learn to write by hand</p>
<p>They should still use traditional sources of information such as books</p>

<p>Families do not have access to books or computers</p>
<p>Literacy rates are often low</p>

<p>Education is the key to improving the economy of these countries</p>
<p>Education in developing countries: solutions</p>
<p>Developed countries could help developing nations by providing money</p>
<p>They could invest in schools and technology</p>
<p>They could supply the funds to build schools and pay for teachers</p>
<p>Children need to have access to free schooling</p>
<p>Computer equipment could be donated</p>
<p>The Internet can expose students to a world of knowledge and information</p>
<p>Governments should make education compulsory for all children</p>
<p>They should encourage parents to send their children to school</p>
<p>Governments of developed and developing countries must work together</p>
<p>Higher education: Advantages (also see “benefits of education”)</p>
<p>There are many benefits to going to university</p>
<p>A degree can open the door to better employment prospects</p>
<p>18 / 52</p>
<p>Economies are becoming increasingly knowledge-based</p>
<p>Most jobs require specific knowledge and skills</p>
<p>Skilled workers are needed for sectors such as information technology and</p>
<p>engineering</p>
<p>Repetitive manual jobs are now done by machine</p>
<p>Many factories have moved to developing countries</p>
<p>Higher education: Disadvantages</p>
<p>A healthy economy needs a wide range of workers</p>
<p>Some manual workers will always be needed</p>
<p>A university degree is not necessary for many service professions</p>
<p>Practical training is more important in some industries</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, there is currently a shortage of plumbers</p>
<p>Their services are therefore becoming more and more expensive</p>
<p>Advantage of Home-schooling</p>
<p>Some parents decide to educate their children at home</p>
<p>Some families live in isolated areas with poor transport</p>
<p>Other parents are not satisfied with local schools</p>
<p>Parents can respond to what their children need and how they learn best</p>
<p>One-to-one lessons allow much faster progress</p>
<p>The child can work at his or her own pace</p>
<p>Discipline problems are avoided by home-schooling</p>
<p>Disadvantages of home-schooling</p>
<p>Most parents do not have the time to educate their children at home</p>
<p>One parent would need to give up work</p>
<p>School subjects are normally taught by up to ten different teachers</p>
<p>19 / 52</p>
<p>Most parents do not have the necessary knowledge or resources</p>
<p>Private tutors are expensive</p>
<p>Children will miss out on the social experience that school offers</p>
<p>At school, children learn how to get on with each other</p>
<p>Home-schooled children may lack social skills</p>
<p>Schools offer a better overall educational experience</p>
<p>Bad behavior in schools: causes</p>
<p>Bad behavior is due to a lack of structure and discipline</p>
<p>There are too many children in some classes</p>
<p>Large classes are difficult to manage</p>
<p>May disruptive students come from an unstable family background</p>
<p>Other parents are too lenient and spoil their children</p>
<p>Some children are used to getting whatever they want</p>
<p>Schools can do very little if they are not supported by parents</p>
<p>Bad behavior in schools: solutions</p>
<p>Schools need a clear code of conduct</p>
<p>Schools need a clear set of rules about behavior</p>
<p>They need to create a positive working atmosphere</p>
<p>Teachers must have the power to punish disruptive students</p>
<p>Schools should remove difficult children from lessons</p>
<p>Schools need to work closely with parents</p>
<p>Discipline could be lacking at home</p>
<p>Parents must support the school rules</p>
<p>They should take responsibility for their children’s behavior</p>
<p>20 / 52</p>
<p>Corporal Punishment: Opinion</p>
<p>Corporal Punishment is not a good idea</p>
<p>Physical punishment is a way of controlling children using fear</p>
<p>This does not promote trust between adults and children</p>
<p>Children who are punished physically may become shy or resentful</p>
<p>Corporal punishment creates an atmosphere of fear and anger</p>
<p>Single Sex Education: Advantages</p>
<p>Some people believe that male and female students should go to separate schools</p>
<p>This is often for religious or cultural reasons</p>
<p>Discipline problems might be avoided by separating boys and girls</p>
<p>Boys and girls may learn in different ways and have different needs</p>
<p>Student at single-sex schools often get better exam grades.</p>
<p>Single-sex Education: Disadvantages</p>
<p>Separating boys and girls is unnecessary</p>
<p>It is unhealthy in terms of children’s social development</p>
<p>Many coeducational schools are extremely successful</p>
<p>A mixed-sex environment is more representative of real life</p>
<p>Coeducational schools provide children with better social skills for adult life</p>
<p>Advantages of Streaming (grouping children according to ability)</p>
<p>Some schools separate students according to their academic ability</p>
<p>Teachers can work at the right speed for their students</p>
<p>Teachers can plan more suitable lessons</p>
<p>High-level groups may progress faster</p>
<p>Lower level groups can benefits from a slower pace</p>
<p>Some teachers and parents support streaming for these reasons</p>
<p>21 / 52</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Streaming</p>
<p>Grouping by ability may have a negative impact on students</p>
<p>Children do not want to be seen as less intelligent than others</p>
<p>Streaming could damage students’ self esteem</p>
<p>They may lose motivation</p>
<p>Students from wealthier families tend to be better prepared</p>
<p>Children from poorer families may receive less support from parents</p>
<p>Mixed ability classes encourage everyone to achieve their potential.</p>

  <li>Environment</li>
</ol>
<p>Global warming</p>
<p>Gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat from the sun</p>
<p>This causes global temperatures to rise</p>
<p>This process is known as the greenhouse effect</p>
<p>Human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases</p>
<p>Factories and vehicles produce emissions and exhaust fumes</p>
<p>Many developing countries are becoming industrialized</p>
<p>The number of cars on our streets is growing</p>
<p>Cheap air travel is allowing more people to fly</p>
<p>Effects of Global Warming</p>
<p>Global warming will have a significant impact on our planet</p>
<p>Rising temperature will cause melting of the polar ice caps</p>
<p>Sea levels will rise</p>
<p>We can expect more extreme weather conditions</p>
<p>Flooding and droughts may become more common</p>
<p>22 / 52</p>
<p>Impacts of humans on the environment</p>
<p>The increasing world population is putting pressure on natural resources</p>
<p>Fossil fuels like oil and gas are running out</p>
<p>We are destroying wildlife habitats</p>
<p>We have cut down enormous areas of rainforest</p>
<p>This has led to the extinction of many species of animals and plants</p>
<p>Solutions to environment problems</p>
<p>Governments could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories</p>
<p>They should invest in renewable energy from solar, wind or water power</p>
<p>They could impose “green taxes” on drivers and airlines companies</p>
<p>Government campaigns should promote recycling</p>
<p>Natural areas and wild animals should be protected</p>
<p>Individuals should also try to be greener</p>
<p>We should take fewer flights abroad for holidays</p>
<p>We should take public transport rather than driving</p>
<p>We should choose products with less packaging</p>
<p>We should recycle as much as possible</p>
<p>Waste/rubbish</p>
<p>The amount of waster we produce has increased</p>
<p>This problem is a result of our consumer culture</p>
<p>Products are not made to last</p>
<p>If something breaks, we throw it way and buy a new one</p>
<p>Advertisers encourage is to buy the newest fashions</p>
<p>Packaging is an important part of selling</p>
<p>Most foods are sold in non-biodegradable plastics packaging</p>
<p>23 / 52</p>
<p>The amount of household waste is growing</p>
<p>This waste ends up in landfill sites</p>
<p>Litter</p>
<p>People do not think about the consequences of dropping rubbish</p>
<p>They assume that somebody is pad to clean the streest</p>
<p>Plastic packaging does not break down easily</p>
<p>Most of the litter seen on streets is fast food packaging</p>
<p>Recycling and other solutions</p>
<p>Companies should make goods that last longer</p>
<p>They should not use so much packaging</p>
<p>Governments should be stricter, about waster produced by companies</p>
<p>They should put legal limits on packaging</p>
<p>Consumers should avoid buying over-packaged products</p>
<p>We should recycle and reuse useful materials.</p>
<p>There are collection banks for glass, paper and plastic bottles</p>
<p>Households can use several rubbish bins to separate waste</p>
<p>Recycling saves energy and raw materials.</p>
<p>Nuclear Power: Positives</p>
<p>There are several benefits to build more nuclear power stations</p>
<p>Fossil fuel like oil and gas are running out</p>
<p>Nuclear power is a sustainable energy source</p>
<p>It can be used to produce electricity without wasting natural resources</p>
<p>It could be replace the use of natural resources like coal, oil or gas</p>
<p>Nuclear power stations are cleaner than fossil fuel power stations</p>
<p>They could help to reduce carbon emissions that cause global warming</p>
<p>24 / 52</p>
<p>The risks of accidents are being reduced</p>
<p>Nuclear Power: negatives</p>
<p>Opponents of nuclear power worry about the safety of power stations</p>
<p>The building of new nuclear power stations is unpopular</p>
<p>Nobody wants to live near one</p>
<p>Nuclear waste disposal is a significant problem</p>
<p>There is currently no way to decontaminate radioactive material</p>
<p>People worry that terrorists could steal radioactive materials</p>
<p>It is safer to produce energy from solar, wind or water power.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Family</li>
</ol>
<p>Family size</p>
<p>Families in many countries are not as large as they used to be</p>
<p>We tend to live in small nuclear families rather than large extended families</p>
<p>Parents tend to have fewer children</p>
<p>Young children are no longer expected to work</p>
<p>Nowadays both parents often work</p>
<p>It costs so much to bring children up</p>
<p>It is more difficult to raise a large family</p>
<p>Working parents (also see “gender” topic)</p>
<p>Children and their parents seem to be less close nowadays</p>

<p>behavior</p>
<p>Teenagers are influenced by peer pressure</p>
<p>Some of them join gangs</p>
<p>Juvenile delinquency is on the increase</p>
<p>Parents should be more involved with their children’s upbringing</p>
<p>Young people need positive role models</p>
<p>Divorce</p>
<p>In the past, divorce was unacceptable</p>
<p>It was considered to be embarrassing for a family</p>
<p>People stayed together for religious or family reasons</p>
<p>Divorce is more socially acceptable nowadays</p>
<p>It has become much more common</p>
<p>Divorce can be extremely stressful</p>
<p>Lone parents may face financial difficulties</p>
<p>Many single parents have to rely on benefits paid by the state</p>
<p>Divorce can have a negative effect on children</p>
<p>Children from single-parent families are more likely to get lower grades or drop</p>
<p>out of school.</p>
<p>The rise in divorce rates may be connected to some social problems</p>
<p>Care for Old people</p>
<p>Caring for elderly people was traditionally the responsibility of families</p>
<p>Adults had to look after their elderly parents</p>
<p>A woman’s job was to stay at home taking care of her family</p>
<p>Nowadays, fewer elderly people are looked after by their relatives</p>
<p>Residential homes provide care for large number of elderly people</p>
<p>Some families are unable to look after elderly relatives</p>
<p>Families tend to be smaller these days, and women often have full-time jobs</p>
<p>Cares homes provide a professional service for senior citizens</p>
<p>Nurses are better trained than family members</p>
<p>26 / 52</p>
<p>Care for Old people: Opinion</p>
<p>The best form of care for the elderly depends on the family situation</p>
<p>It depends on whether family members have the time resources</p>
<p>We all have a responsibility towards the older people in our society</p>
<p>Governments should invest money in facilities and training for care workers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gender</li>
</ol>
<p>Gender and education</p>
<p>Men and women should have access to the same educational opportunities</p>
<p>Males and females should be accepted onto courses according to their abilities</p>
<p>It is wrong to discriminate against students because of their gender</p>
<p>Gender should be irrelevant in education</p>
<p>Student’s achievements should depend on hard work and individual merit</p>
<p>In the UK, there are similar numbers of male and female students in higher</p>
<p>education</p>
<p>Gender and work</p>
<p>Men and women should have access to the same professional opportunities</p>
<p>Both man and women should be able to pursue a career</p>
<p>They should earn equal salaries</p>
<p>They should be employed according to their abilities, qualifications and</p>
<p>experience</p>
<p>Traditionally women have been restricted to certain roles</p>
<p>They were often employed as secretaries or receptionists</p>
<p>Nowadays, a range of occupations is available to both sexes</p>
<p>Career success depends on individual merit</p>
<p>Women’s and Men’s roles in the Family</p>
<p>Some people argue that a mother should not work</p>
<p>She should stay at home and bring up her children</p>
<p>The father should be the breadwinner of the family</p>
<p>Others believe that both parents should share these responsibilities</p>
<p>Working women can take maternity leave during and after pregnancy</p>
<p>Many mothers continue to work after this period</p>
<p>Many fathers and mothers share their parenting and domestic responsibilities</p>
<p>They contribute equally to childcare, cooking and cleaning</p>
<p>Some women many have better career prospects than their husbands.</p>
<p>27 / 52</p>
<p>Paternity leave and “househusbands” are becoming more common</p>
<p>Traditional gender roles and gradually changing</p>
<p>Families can divide roles and responsibilities in the most convenient way.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Genetic Engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>Positives of genetic engineering</p>
<p>Genetic engineering is the practice of manipulating the genes of an organism</p>
<p>It is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases</p>
<p>Some genetically modified crops grow more quickly</p>
<p>Some drugs and vaccines are produced by genetic engineering</p>
<p>It may become possible to change human’s genetic characteristics.</p>
<p>Scientists may use genetic engineering to cure diseases.</p>
<p>Inherited illnesses would no longer exist</p>
<p>Genes could be changed before a baby is born</p>
<p>It could also be possible to clone human organs</p>
<p>We could all have replacement body part</p>
<p>Humans could live longer, healthier lives</p>
<p>Negatives of genetic engineering</p>
<p>There are ethical concerns about human genetic engineering</p>
<p>Parents might want to choose their children’s characteristics</p>
<p>This would be unnatural</p>
<p>It would be unacceptable in most religions</p>
<p>Soldiers could be cloned from the genes of the strongest people</p>
<p>Clones might be used like robots to do certain jobs</p>
<p>Clones might even be developed just for organ replacements</p>
<p>Society and human evolution would change completely</p>
<p>Currently, human genetic engineering is prohibited</p>
<p>Genetically-Modified (GM) foods: Advantages</p>
<p>Farmers can produce crops that grow bigger and faster</p>
<p>Some GM crops are more resistant to disease or insects</p>
<p>This could be important for food production in developing countries</p>
<p>Faster growing cereals, fruit and vegetables will mean more profit</p>
<p>GM foods can be modified to look perfect</p>
<p>28 / 52</p>
<p>They may be more attractive to customers</p>
<p>Genetically-Modified (GM) Foods: Disadvantages</p>
<p>There may be risks involved in the genetic engineering of foods.</p>
<p>GM crops might change whole ecosystems</p>
<p>Food chains could be broken if crops are resistant to predators</p>
<p>Organic foods are produced without chemicals or genetic modification</p>
<p>Organic farming may be slower and more expensive</p>
<p>However, the environment is not damaged by fertilizers or pesticides.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Global issues</li>
</ol>
<p>Problems in developing countries</p>
<p>Developing countries face a range if problems</p>
<p>Standards of healthcare and education are low</p>
<p>Life expectancy is usually lower than in developed countries</p>
<p>There is a lack of infrastructure, employment and good quality housing</p>
<p>Many people are forced to live in poverty</p>
<p>Food, drinking water and basic medicines are in short supply</p>
<p>How to help developing countries</p>
<p>The best form of help for developing countries is development aid</p>
<p>Richer nations can help by investing in long-term projects</p>
<p>Governments and charities can help by building new houses and schools</p>
<p>Globalization may also help developing countries</p>
<p>Multi-national companies can creating jobs in developing countries</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people emigrate to find work in richer countries</p>
<p>They often sand money back home to their families</p>
<p>This money helps to improve the standard of living in developing countries</p>
<p>Immigration</p>
<p>Some people move to another countries in search of a better life</p>
<p>Many immigrants come from less developed countries</p>
<p>Richer, industrialized countries may offer opportunities for employment</p>
<p>Free healthcare and schooling are available in some developed countries</p>
<p>29 / 52</p>
<p>Other people migrate to a foreign country to improve their academic</p>
<p>qualifications</p>
<p>Positives of immigration and Multi-cultural societies</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, immigration can be extremely positive</p>
<p>Many immigrants have skills that are needed in the country they move to</p>
<p>Immigrants who find work contribute to the economy of their new country</p>
<p>Many immigrants send money home to help family members</p>
<p>Immigration also creates cultural diversity</p>
<p>People of many different nationalities learn to live together</p>
<p>This can help people to become more open-minded and tolerant</p>
<p>Negatives of Immigration</p>
<p>Some people believe that immigrants take jobs that should go to local people</p>
<p>Some immigrant workers work longer hours for less money</p>
<p>Companies might pay lower salaries to immigrant workers</p>
<p>Unemployment rates could rise if there are too many immigrants</p>
<p>Opinions about Immigration</p>
<p>Immigration can help the economy of a country</p>
<p>It can create multi-cultural societies</p>
<p>However, immigration needs to be controlled</p>
<p>In many countries, immigrants need visas or work permit</p>
<p>Governments should stop companies from exploiting immigrant workers</p>
<p>Foreign and local workers should have the right to equal pay and conditions</p>
<p>Positives of Globalization</p>
<p>Business of becoming increasingly international</p>
<p>Multi-national companies do business across the world</p>
<p>Companies like MacDonald’s can be seen on high streets in most cities</p>
<p>Goods are produced in one country and sold in many others</p>
<p>A global economy means free trade between countries</p>
<p>This can strengthen political relationships</p>
<p>Globalization can also create opportunities for employment</p>
<p>It encourages investment in less developed countries</p>
<p>30 / 52</p>
<p>It could reduce poverty in the developing world</p>
<p>Negatives of Globalization</p>
<p>Globalization is not always beneficial to everyone</p>
<p>Companies can move to countries where labour is cheap</p>
<p>This creates redundancies, or job losses</p>
<p>Employees cannot be confident that they have stable jobs</p>
<p>Companies sometimes exploit their employees in developing countries</p>
<p>Global trade creates more waste and pollution</p>
<p>The future of Globalization</p>
<p>There should be global regulations for salaries and working conditions</p>
<p>Governments should impose laws to protect the environment</p>
<ol>
  <li>Government and Society</li>
</ol>
<p>What governments can do</p>
<p>Governments provide public services like healthcare and education</p>
<p>They support people who are living in poverty or unable to work</p>
<p>Governments raise money by taxing working people</p>
<p>They can spend money on resources and campaigns</p>
<p>They can introduce new laws</p>
<p>They can impose taxes</p>
<p>They can raise people’s awareness of issues (e.g climate change/healthy eating)</p>
<p>They can influence people’s habits and opinions</p>
<p>They can create jobs</p>
<p>They can regulate the activities of companies such as banks</p>
<p>They can provide resources for schools</p>
<p>They are also responsible for the security and well-being of their citizens</p>
<p>They control armed forces and police forces</p>
<p>Public services</p>
<p>Governments pay the salaries of public sector workers like police officers and</p>
<p>teachers</p>
<p>The necessary money is raised by taxing people’s income</p>
<p>31 / 52</p>
<p>Free education and healthcare may be provided by the state</p>
<p>Some governments control public transport systems and even TV channels</p>
<p>In other countries, these services are provided by private companies</p>
<p>Some people believe that competition between private companies is good</p>
<p>It helps to improve quality while bringing prices down</p>
<p>Other people think that essential services should be free</p>
<p>Governments should pay for them</p>
<p>Censorship: Opinion</p>
<p>Governments can censor what public sees or reads in the media</p>
<p>To a certain extent censorship is necessary</p>
<p>We should use censorship to protect children from violent images</p>
<p>Some computer games involve killing people or committing crimes</p>
<p>The Internet also needs to be controlled</p>
<p>Many websites show pornography and violence</p>
<p>There should be age limits for websites and computers games</p>
<p>Parents need to take responsibility for checking what their children watch</p>
<p>It is impossible for governments to control everything we see</p>
<p>Video cameras in public places</p>
<p>The use of CCTV is becoming widespread</p>
<p>Video cameras have been installed in many public places</p>
<p>They are supposed to protect us and deter criminals</p>
<p>Many people think that this surveillance violates our privacy</p>
<p>The authorities could build databases with our pictures and identities</p>
<p>We should not be treated like criminals</p>
<p>Smart cards: Positives</p>
<p>Governments will probably introduce a digital identification card system</p>
<p>Smart cards will have benefits and drawbacks</p>
<p>They could help to reduce crime</p>
<p>They could hold personal information, such as DNA</p>
<p>Digital bank cards could contain fingerprint information</p>
<p>It would be very difficult for criminals to use a stolen card</p>
<p>It would be easier for police to identify people and catch criminals</p>
<p>32 / 52</p>
<p>Smart cards: Negatives</p>
<p>Many people are worried about losing their privacy</p>
<p>Governments could store all our personal and medical information</p>
<p>This information could be used by insurance companies</p>
<p>Employers could check our health records</p>
<p>People with Disabilities</p>
<p>People with disabilities should be treated the same as everybody else</p>
<p>They should have the same rights as other people</p>
<p>They should have access to the same jobs as other citizens</p>
<p>Discriminations against disabled people is illegal in many countries</p>
<p>Ramps and lifts for wheelchairs should be installed in public buildings</p>
<p>Support teacher can be employed to help children with learning difficulties</p>
<ol>
  <li>Guns and Weapons</li>
</ol>
<p>Why guns should be legal:</p>
<p>In some countries, people are allowed to own firearms</p>
<p>Individuals have the right to protect themselves</p>
<p>People can use guns in self defence</p>
<p>This deters criminals</p>
<p>Why gun ownership should be illegal:</p>
<p>There is a risk of accidents with guns</p>
<p>The number of violent crimes increases when guns are available</p>
<p>Criminals may be armed</p>
<p>The police then need to use guns</p>
<p>Suicide rates have been shown to rise when guns are available</p>
<p>Guns create violent societies with high murder rates</p>
<p>Why polices should use guns</p>
<p>Many criminals use weapons</p>
<p>The threat of a gun can deter criminals</p>
<p>Police officers can forces a criminal to surrender</p>
<p>33 / 52</p>
<p>It is easier to arrest someone and avoid physical violence</p>
<p>The police may shoot violent criminals in self defence</p>
<p>They can protect the public</p>
<p>They can shoot an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public</p>
<p>Why police should not carry guns</p>
<p>There is a risk of accidents and mistakes</p>
<p>The police might shoot an unarmed criminal or an innocent person</p>
<p>Accidents can happen in public places</p>
<p>There are several alternatives to guns (e.g tear gas, sprays and electric shock</p>
<p>weapons)</p>
<p>Only special police units should use guns</p>
<p>Arm Trade: Positives</p>
<p>The export of arms, or weapons, is an extremely controversial issue</p>
<p>Governments of rich, industrialized countries sell arms to each other</p>
<p>This industry creates jobs and wealth</p>
<p>The trade of weapons may improve relationships between governments</p>
<p>Arms Trade: Negatives</p>
<p>Weapons may be used in conflicts and wars</p>
<p>The supply of arms could be responsible for deaths</p>
<p>Governments are promoting war in order to make a profit</p>
<p>Rich countries can influence the politics of other nations</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons are capable of destroying whole cities</p>
<p>A nuclear war between two countries would destroy both countries</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons are used as a deterrent</p>
<p>They prevent wars from starting</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons: Opinion</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons should be prohibited</p>
<p>Governments should limit the production of nuclear weapons</p>
<p>There is a danger of nuclear weapons being obtained by terrorists</p>
<p>34 / 52</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons cannot be used against terrorist organizations</p>
<p>Armed Forces: Positives</p>
<p>Armed forces provide security and protection</p>
<p>They deter military attack by another country</p>
<p>They can also be sued to maintain peace within countries</p>
<p>They can be sued to give the police extra support</p>
<p>Soldiers are also used to help in emergency situations, such as after a natural</p>

</ol>
<p>Diet</p>
<p>The human body requires a balanced diet</p>
<p>An unhealthy diet can cause various health problems</p>
<p>Obesity, diabetes and heart disease are on the increase</p>
<p>Many people nowadays rely on fast food or pre-prepared meals</p>
<p>These foods often contain too much fat, salt and sugar</p>
<p>They are cheap to buy and very easy to prepare</p>
<p>Many young people have grown up on a diet of convenience foods</p>
<p>Populations in developed countries are increasingly overweight</p>
<p>Exercise</p>
<p>Regular exercise is essential in maintaining a healthy body</p>
<p>Exercise burns calories and helps to build healthy bones and muscles</p>
<p>Doctors advise exercising at least three times a week for 20 minutes</p>
<p>Most people nowadays lead a sedentary lifestyle</p>
<p>We tend to walk less and do desk jobs</p>
<p>Most adults relax by watching television</p>
<p>Children play video games rather than doing outdoor sports</p>
<p>In the past, people were more active in their jobs and at home</p>
<p>35 / 52</p>
<p>Government’s Role</p>
<p>Governments have a significant role to play in reducing obesity</p>
<p>More and more people, including young children are seriously overweight</p>
<p>They are at risk of heart disease and diabetes</p>
<p>This situation will increase the burden on hospitals and taxpayers</p>
<p>Hospitals rely on the government for money and resources</p>
<p>Governments should promote a healthy diet and regular exercise</p>
<p>There should be more time for sports on school timetables</p>
<p>Unhealthy junk food should be banned from school menus</p>
<p>People need information about what foods contain</p>
<p>Food packaging must show the food’s nutritional content</p>
<p>The British Government recommends eating five portions of fruit and vegetables</p>
<p>per day</p>
<p>State Health system: advantages</p>
<p>Good healthcare should be available to everyone for free</p>
<p>State healthcare is paid by the government using money from taxes</p>
<p>Everyone has access to the same quality of care and treatment</p>
<p>Private healthcare is unfair because only wealthy people can afford it</p>
<p>The National Health Service in the UK provides free healthcare for every resident</p>
<p>Private Healthcare: advantages</p>
<p>State hospitals are often very large and difficult to run</p>
<p>Private hospitals have shorter waiting lists for operations and appointments</p>
<p>Patients can benefit from faster treatment</p>
<p>Many people prefer to pay for more a personal service</p>
<p>Patients have their own room and more comfortable facilities</p>
<p>Alternative medicine: Positives</p>
<p>People are increasingly using alternative medicines to treat illnesses.</p>
<p>For example, acupuncture can be used to treat backache</p>
<p>Herbal medicines can be used to treat allergies or viruses</p>
<p>Many patients report positive experiences with these treatments</p>
<p>Some traditional cures have been used for hundreds of years</p>
<p>36 / 52</p>
<p>Alternative medicine: Negatives</p>
<p>Many alternative medicines have not been tested scientifically</p>
<p>They may have no beneficial effect at all</p>
<p>They may cause unknown side effects</p>
<p>People should trust the opinions of qualified doctors</p>
<p>An illness could get worse without treatment from a doctor</p>
<p>Stress</p>
<p>Modern lifestyles are increasingly stressful</p>
<p>People work long hours with strict deadlines</p>
<p>Our busy lifestyles mean we have less time to relax</p>
<p>Unemployment is a major cause of stress</p>
<p>Children may be affected by their parents’ relationship problems</p>
<p>Tests and exams can also cause stress</p>
<p>How to reduce stress</p>
<p>Stress can be reduced by taking regular exercise and eating a healthy diet</p>
<p>It is also important to get sufficient sleep and make leisure time a priority</p>
<p>People should work less overtime and take regular holidays</p>

  <li>Housing and Architecture</li>
</ol>
<p>State/council housing</p>
<p>In some countries the government provides state or council housing</p>
<p>This helps people who cannot afford to buy their own house</p>
<p>It can be argued that state housing creates dependence on the government</p>
<p>People should be rely on the government to look after them</p>
<p>People have no incentive to earn money and buy their own home</p>
<p>Council properties are often made with cheap, poor-quality materials.</p>
<p>Old Buildings</p>
<p>Historic buildings are part of a country’s heritage</p>
<p>37 / 52</p>
<p>They should be protected</p>
<p>Old buildings are often considered to be works or art</p>
<p>They give character to cities and attract tourists</p>
<p>They show us how people lived in the past</p>
<p>We identify countries by architectural symbols like the pyramids in Egypt</p>
<p>Governments should spend money on looking after historic buildings</p>
<p>They need regular repairs and maintenance</p>
<p>New buildings should be designed to complement them</p>
<p>Modern/green buildings</p>
<p>Modern buildings should be designed to be environmentally friendly</p>
<p>They should use less energy and produce less waste</p>
<p>Modern insulation can make houses more energy-efficient</p>
<p>Solar and wind power can be used to generate electricity</p>
<p>Rainwater and waste water can be recycled and used to flush toilets.</p>
<p>Modern glass buildings take advantage if natural light</p>

  <li>Language</li>
</ol>
<p>English as an international language</p>
<p>English is widely used around the world</p>
<p>It is becoming a global second language</p>
<p>It is the dominant language of technology, science and international business</p>
<p>International business meetings are regularly held in English</p>
<p>The most important textbooks and journals are published in English</p>
<p>The ability to speak English is a necessary skill in the modern world</p>
<p>Negative of English as an International Language</p>
<p>If one language is dominant, other languages may disappear</p>
<p>The dominant language brings its own culture</p>
<p>American culture has become popular around the world</p>
<p>Other cultures may be damaged</p>
<p>As an alternative to English, a new global language could be invented</p>
<p>It would have no nationality or culture attached to it</p>
<p>This could help to promote international peace and understanding</p>
<p>Esperanto is an example of a language that was invented with this aim</p>

</ol>
<p>Money and Society</p>
<p>Society has become increasingly materialistic</p>
<p>People aspire to earn more money</p>
<p>They want a bigger house or a better car</p>
<p>We connect wealth and material possessions with happiness and success</p>
<p>Brands like “Armani” or ”Mercedes” are status symbols</p>
<p>Advertising creates new desires and needs</p>
<p>It persuades us to buy the latest styles</p>

<p>It helps to reduce poverty</p>

<p>Consumerist societies create more waste</p>
<p>They use more natural resources</p>
<p>They cause damage to the environment</p>
<p>Consumerism creates a “throw-away” culture</p>
<p>Advertisers tell us who we are and what we want</p>
<p>Wealth does not lead to happiness</p>
<p>Materialism causes greed and crime</p>
<p>We should return to traditional values like sharing</p>

<p>Success</p>
<p>People define success in different ways</p>
<p>Some people get a sense of achievement from raising a family</p>
<p>For others, success is defined by wealth or status</p>
<p>We often think of rich and famous people as being successful in life</p>

<p>They have risen to the top in their chosen professions</p>
<p>For some, being successful means achieving personal or professional goals</p>
<p>They see success as the result of hard work</p>
<p>Success in any field requires long-term planning and effort</p>
<p>Nature or Nurture</p>

<p>We inherit our abilities and talents from our parents</p>
<p>Others think that our education and upbringing are more important</p>
<p>We develop according to the influences around us</p>
<p>Our personalities and achievements depend more on nurture than nature</p>

<p>By working hard we can achieve and goal that we put our minds to</p>
<p>Many successful people are “self-made”</p>
<p>We are not limited by our genetic characteristic or upbringing</p>

<p>We could all live happily without professional football</p>
<p>Life would be difficult without doctors, engineers and other vital professionals.</p>

<p>The internet can now be used to connect people</p>
<p>More people could work from home</p>
<p>Meetings can be held as video conferences</p>
<p>Workers could be given flexible timetables</p>
<p>Another solution would be to tax drivers</p>
<p>Workers should share their cars and travel together</p>
<p>In London, for example, there is a congestion charge</p>

<p>They do not think about how much water they waste</p>
<p>They leave taps running while washing or brushing their teeth</p>
<p>If we have to pay for water, we will use it more responsibly</p>
<p>Water supply systems are extremely expensive</p>
<p>Investment is needed to maintain and improve them</p>
<p>Private companies may provide a better service than governments</p>
<p>If they provide an efficient service, they will make more money</p>
<p>They will repair leaks to avoid losing money</p>
<p>Bottled Water: Opinions</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>流向地图火了，因为Facebook的那张著名的友邻图，抑或因为《数据可视化之美》中介绍飞行模式的航线图，总之，流向地图以它特殊的可视化形式，直观地展示事物之间的联系，尤其在展示网络流向、贸易流向、迁徙路线等方面具有天然的优势。</p>
<p>Flow maps - show the movement of some phenomenon, normally goods or people, from
  one place to another. Lines are used to symbolize the flow, typically varied in
  width to represent differences in the quantity of the flow.</p>
<p>　　上面这段话是Flow Map的定义（Buckley,2013,AAG），流向地图的特点就在于展示移动的地理现象，利用线的粗细或是颜色来展示更多的信息。当我们惊叹于那优美的线条以及绚丽的可视化效果时，不由得会想到，怎么才能做出这么一张流向地图呢？ArcGIS是否能够快速的实现呢？</p>
<pre><code>其实早在2011年，Esri的制图专家Mamata Akella就发表了一篇Blog，介绍在ArcGIS中实现一种流向地图的方法[1] ，来展示2011年Esri用户大会的参会者来源，如下图所示。
![1](/ArcGIS制作放射状流向地图/1.png)
</code></pre>
<p>这里我们也以一个实例来尝试如何快速生成该类型的地图，在这个例子里，我们把帝都北京和其他各国家的首都连接起来，通过结果可以看到帝都与各首都之间航线的轨迹和距离，这里我们主要是利用ArcGIS的一个工具——XY
  to line。 </p>
<p>数据准备：XY to line工具所需要的输入是一个表格数据（.xls,.csv,.txt,.dbf均可以），必需的四个字段是每个点对的XY起止坐标，如下图所示，XCoor为各首都的X坐标，YCoord为各首都的Y坐标，BJX为北京的X坐标，BJY为北京的Y坐标，这里采用的是WGS
  1984的坐标系统。
  <br>
  <img src="/ArcGIS制作放射状流向地图/2.png" alt="2">
  <br>数据处理：打开XY to line工具，设置如上图，在Line Type中有四个选项，这里我们选择的是GEODISIC，ID字段设置为大洲，目的是为了保留该字段，以便将来按大洲进行符号化。</p>
<p>GEODESIC：测地线，椭球体表面上两点之间的最短连线</p>
<p>GREAT_CIRCLE: 大圆航线，通过两航路点间的大圆圈线(该两航路点与地心在同一平面)</p>
<p>RHUMB_LINE(loxodrome line): 等角航线：是地球表面上与经线相交成相同角度的曲线。在地球表面上除经线和纬线以外的等角航线，都是以极点为渐近点的螺旋曲线，在航海图（采用墨卡托投影）上又表现为直线</p>
<p>NORMAL_SECTION:法截弧，A点的法线与B点确定的法截面与椭球相交的弧线</p>
<p> 经过简单渲染，我们就得到了这样的地图：
  <br>

  <br> 偶尔换个视角也不错，例如我们把Data Frame的坐标系统换一换，再按大洲做个符号化：

  of situations.For example, as far as I am concerned, 6 this morning arrived early
  and found that the book was cleared, which was very frustrating, so it was inevitable
  to look for the next place.B. After finding other places, he cleared away others’
  books, which inevitably conflicts with others.When two people don’t agree with
  each other, it is the escalation of contradictions.It’s also because, many people,
  a lot of seats are occupied, so the seat is strained.To sum up, taking a seat is
  inevitable, but the study room is public and everyone is entitled to it.At the
  same time, it is the library that provides the resources to learn, so everyone
  wants a place.</p>
